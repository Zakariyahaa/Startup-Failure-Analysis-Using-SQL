## üßæ Project Overview

This analysis examines patterns and causes of startup failures across various sectors from 1992 to 2024. By analyzing 914 failed startups, we identify common failure factors, sector-specific vulnerabilities, and relationships between funding, operational duration, and failure causes. The insights can help entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers understand startup failure dynamics and make more informed decisions.

* **Coverage**: 1992 to May 2024.
* **Sectors**: Combined data from seven sector-specific tables: finance, health, information, retail, manufacturing, othersectors, and food.
* **Features**: Startup name, sector, operational years, funding details, and failure causes.

---

## üõ† Tools Used

* **Database**: PostgreSQL for data processing and analysis
* **Languages**: SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
* **Platform**: Kaggle
* **Documentation**: GitHub for version control and project documentation

## üßπ Data Cleaning/Preparation

Key preprocessing steps executed through SQL:

* **Data consolidation**: Merged data across sectors using `UNION ALL` into a unified table `allsectors`.
* **Duplicates removed**: Applied `DISTINCT` to remove redundant entries.
* **Date extraction**:
  * Extracted `start_year` (4-digit year before hyphen) and `end_year` (4-digit year after hyphen) from textual `years_of_operation`.
  * Calculated `years_operated` using a COALESCE fallback for missing or malformed values.
* **Null values**: Identified missing data in critical columns such as `amount_raised`, `budget_status`, and `failure_reason`.
* **Funding Information**:
  * Extracted `parent_company` from parentheses or after space
  * Parsed `amount_raised` with proper unit conversion (M=million, B=billion)
  * Identified magnitude (M/B) for each amount
* **Failure Analysis**:
  * Extracted primary `reason_why_they_failed` from text after semicolon
  * Extracted `key_takeaway` from text after semicolon
* **Data Enrichment**: Added new columns to the allsectors table:
  * `start_year`, `end_year`, `years_operated`
  * `parent_company`, `amount_raised`
  * `key_takeaway`, `reason_why_they_failed`
* **Data Pruning**: Removed original columns after extracting relevant information:
  * `years_of_operation`
  * `how_much_they_raised`
  * `why_they_failed`
  * `takeaway`

```sql
-- Extracting start_year and end_year
SELECT 
    CAST(SUBSTRING(years_of_operation FROM '(\\d{4})\\s*-') AS INTEGER) AS start_year,
    CAST(SUBSTRING(years_of_operation FROM '-\\s*(\\d{4})') AS INTEGER) AS end_year,
    COALESCE(end_year - start_year, years_operated) AS years_operated
FROM allsectors;
```

* Number of years operated before failure
* Most cited failure reasons
  
* **Sector Distribution**:
  * Total of 914 failed startups analyzed
  * Information sector accounted for 42% of failures (highest among all sectors)
  * Retail, manufacturing, and health sectors followed in failure frequency
* **Operational Duration**:
  * Calculated average years of operation before failure by sector
  * Identified sectors with longest/shortest lifespans before failure

  * Extracted and standardized funding amounts across different notations
  * Identified top 10 most funded startups before failure
  * Analyzed relationship between funding and operational duration
* **Failure Causes**:
  Categorized and quantified primary failure reasons:
  * Competition
  * No budget
  * Stagnation
  * Trend shifts
  * Monetization failure
* **Analyzed sector-specific** patterns in failure causes

## üìà Data Analysis
* **Sector Distribution**
```sql
SELECT 
  sector,
  COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS startup_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT name)::numeric / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT name)) OVER(), 2) AS pct_startup
FROM allsectors
GROUP BY sector
ORDER BY startup_count DESC;
```
* **Funding vs. Longevity Correlation**
```sql
WITH funding AS (
  SELECT sector, ROUND(AVG(amount_raised), 2) AS avg_amount_raised
  FROM allsectors
  WHERE amount_raised IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY sector
),
survival AS (
  SELECT sector, ROUND(AVG(years_operated), 2) AS avg_year_operation
  FROM allsectors
  WHERE years_operated IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY sector
)
SELECT corr(f.avg_amount_raised, s.avg_year_operation) AS correlation 
FROM funding f
JOIN survival s ON f.sector = s.sector;
```
* **Failure Cause Analysis**
```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(no_budget::int),2) pct_no_budget,
  ROUND(AVG(monetization_failure::int),2) pct_monetization_failure,
  ROUND(AVG(trend_shifts::int),2) pct_trend_shifts,
  ROUND(AVG(acquisition_stagnation::int),2) pct_acquisition_stagnation,
  ROUND(AVG(competition::int),2) pct_competition
FROM allsectors;
```
### üî¢ Summary Statistics

## üìå Results/Findings
Summary of Findings
1. **Information sector** is the most volatile with the highest failure rate.
2. **Funding improves survival**: Startups that raised more tend to operate longer.
3. **Budgeting is critical**: Lack of initial budget shows a strong negative correlation with survival and adaptability.
4. **Competition is the #1 killer**, cited by over half of failed startups.

* **Sector Concentration**:
  * 42% of startup failures occurred in the information sector
  * Retail, manufacturing, and health sectors also showed significant failure rates

* **Funding vs. Longevity**:
  * Weak positive correlation (19.8%) between amount raised and years of operation
  * Suggests that while more funding may slightly extend lifespan, it doesn't guarantee success

* **Budget Constraints**:
  * Negative correlation between no budget and stagnation (-20.3%)
  * Stronger negative correlation between no budget and competition (-36.2%)
  * 43% of startups failed due to budget constraints

* **Primary Failure Causes**:
  * Competition: 53% of failures
  * No budget: 43% of failures
  * Stagnation: 21% of failures
  * Trend shifts: 13% of failures
  * Monetization failure: 12% of failures

* **Sector-Specific Budget Issues**:
  * Retail: 69% started with no budget
  * Accommodation and food services: 54%
  * Manufacturing: 53%
  * Health: 38%
  * Information: 35%

## üí° Recommendations
**Summary**
* **Build with a budget**: Startups should secure foundational capital before launch.
* **Market intelligence**: Deeply research competitors and maintain adaptive strategies.
* **Monitor product-market fit**: Address stagnation early with iterative product development.
* **Avoid trends-only models**: Long-term sustainability should be prioritized over short-term hype.
* **Monetization strategy**: Validate revenue models before scaling.

For Entrepreneurs:
  * Conduct thorough competitive analysis before launching (53% fail due to competition)
  * Secure adequate funding and maintain financial runway (43% fail due to budget issues)
  * Monitor industry trends continuously (13% fail due to trend shifts)
  * Develop clear monetization strategies early (12% fail due to monetization issues)

For Investors:
  * Pay particular attention to budget planning when evaluating information sector startups
  * Consider sector-specific risks (e.g., retail's high budget failure rate)
  * Recognize that more funding doesn't guarantee longer survival (low correlation)

For Accelerators/Incubators:
  * Provide more support for competitive positioning
  * Offer financial planning resources, especially for retail and manufacturing startups
  * Help startups develop trend-monitoring capabilities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
**Summary**
* **Incomplete records**: Many rows had null values for key variables like funding or failure reasons.
* **Outliers**: A few records included parent company funding figures, inflating capital raised metrics.
* **Sector imbalance**: Some sectors are underrepresented, skewing comparisons.

Data Completeness:
  * Many records contain incomplete or null values
  * Some critical fields may be missing for certain startups

Funding Data:
  * Parent company funding amounts are included for some startups, creating outliers
  * Inconsistent reporting formats for funding amounts

Time Period:
  * Data spans 1992-2024, but distribution across years are not even
  * Early years may have less complete records

Failure Cause Classification:
  * Reasons are often complex and multifaceted, but dataset simplifies to primary causes
  * Subjective classification of failure reasons

Survivorship Bias:
  * Only includes failed startups, without comparison to successful ones
  * Cannot directly compare characteristics of failed vs. successful startups
